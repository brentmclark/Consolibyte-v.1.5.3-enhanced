 QuickBooks integration support for PHP 5.x+ 
 
 The package you've downloaded contains code and documentation for connecting 
 various versions and editions of QuickBooks to PHP, allowing your PHP 
 applications to do fancy things like:
 
  - Automatically send orders placed on your website to QuickBooks 
  
  - Charge credit cards using the QuickBooks Merchant Service
  
  - Get access to QuickBooks reports 
  
  - Pull information out of QuickBooks and display it online 
  
  - Connect to all Microsoft Windows versions of QuickBooks
  
  - Connect to QuickBooks Online Edition
  
  - etc. etc. etc.
  
  
 Almost anything you can do in the QuickBooks GUI, in QuickBooks Online 
 Edition, and with QuickBooks Merchant Service can be accomplished via this 
 framework. 

    If you have questions, suggestions, or find a bug, please feel free to 
    get in touch with me!

 RECOMMENDATIONS: 
  
 QuickBooks integration can be a *beast* to develop for and debug. You will 
 save yourself *countless* hours if you configure PHP so that: 
 	- error_reporting = E_ALL | E_STRICT
 	- display_errors = On
 	- display_startup_errors = On
 	- log_errors = On
 	- error_log = /path/to/your/log/file.log
 
 No, seriously. Go set up your PHP development server like that. I promise that 
 it will make your life easier, at least as far as QuickBooks development goes.
 
 I would *highly* encourage you to at least download and install the QuickBooks 
 SDK. Most of the implementation details are hidden from you, but you *will* 
 need the QuickBooks OSR to look up the qbXML request/response schema, and you 
 will find that the QuickBooks XML Validator tool is very helpful for 
 debugging.
