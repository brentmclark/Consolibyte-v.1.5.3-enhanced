The API is *highly* experimental right now, and many of the API methods 
*do not* work yet. 

That said, if you want to try it out, have at it, and let me know when you find 
bugs or missing features. 



There are two components required to use the API:
 - The QuickBooks_API client  			$client = new QuickBooks_API(...); $client->addCustomer(...);
 - The QuickBooks_Server_API server		$server = new QuickBooks_Server_API(...); $server->handle();
 
Before you begin using the API client, you should set up your API server as 
shown in the docs/example_api_server.php file. *YOU CANNOT USE THE REGULAR 
QUICKBOOKS SERVER ($server = new QuickBooks_Server(...)) WITH THE API CLIENT*. 
You *MUST* use the API server ($server = new QuickBooks_Server_API(...);)

In addition, *YOU CANNOT USER THE SAME USERNAME FOR BOTH A REGULAR QUICKBOOKS 
SERVER AND A QUICKBOOKS API SERVER*. Create two users with 
QuickBooks_Utilities::createUser(...) and use each with their own username if 
you want to use both servers.
