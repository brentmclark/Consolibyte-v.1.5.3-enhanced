 - Does your web application require real-time access to QuickBooks data?
 - Did you ever wish you could query QuickBooks using SQL queries?
 - Is RDS too slow or just not viable for your integration solution? 
 - Don't want to pay for the (slow, annoying, ODBC) "official" QODBC driver?
 
   Mirror your QuickBooks database in your SQL database of choice and avoid all 
   of those problems!
