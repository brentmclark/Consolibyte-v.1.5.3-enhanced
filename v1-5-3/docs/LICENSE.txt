All code for the QuickBooks PHP Framework is released under a 4-clause 
BSD-style license. The license essentially says that you are free to use this 
code/package in any project *however* you must keep the copyright messages for 
the code intact *and* if you use this project in a commercial project, you need 
to mention that your project uses mine. 

* IF YOU ARE AN OPEN-SOURCE PROJECT * and want to use this code, but the BSD 
license is causing you problems... please get it touch with me and I'll see 
what I can do! 

If the license issues cause problems for you and you would like to be able to 
use the code under a different license, contact me and I'm sure we can work 
something out.
