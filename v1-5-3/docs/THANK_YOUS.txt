I just want to say thank you to the following individuals who have contributed 
to the package either by:
	1. Helping out in some big way (bug fixes, code contributions, suggestions, etc.)
	2. Hiring me for consulting work (so that I actually get some return for the hundreds of my own hours I've spent producing this framework)
	



Special thanks go out to Mike Satkevich (mike AT-SIGN sysgbs DOT-SIGN com) for: 
 - Lamenting about poor ODBC access to QuickBooks and thus inspiring the 
 	QuickBooks schema mirrored-in-an-SQL-database part of release 1.5.0. 
 - Querying me about support for other scripting languages, and thus inspiring 
 	the language bridge support for other scripting languages like Python, ASP, 
 	etc. included in release 1.5.0.
	
Thanks to Ron Brogden (slave AT-SIGN codegrunt DOT-SIGN com) and CardBlanks.com for:
 - Inspiring and partially funding the development of a Zen-Cart QuickBooks 
 	plugin that uses the framework, and also for the 'Associations/Idents' 
 	features in release 1.5.0.
 	
Thanks to Stephane at HolyWorks Corp (holy.works01 AT-SIGN gmail DOT-SIGN com for:
 - Helping to fund the PostgreSQL database server support that has been re-worked 
	and added to release v1.5.0. 
 	
Thanks also to everyone on the Intuit forums for providing feedback, bug 
reports, feature requests, etc.! You guys have been a great help and have 
really helped in keeping me moving forward on this project!

 - Keith
